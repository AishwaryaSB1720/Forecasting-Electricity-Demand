# Forecasting-Electricity-Demand
Worked on historical electricity consumption data spanning over four decades to predict future demand. Built a time series model using Facebook Prophet and achieved a MAPE of 3.6%. This project gave me hands-on experience with trends, seasonality, and forecasting techniques relevant to energy planning.
